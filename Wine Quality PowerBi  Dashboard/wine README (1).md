# Power BI Wine Quality Dashboard

## Overview
This Power BI project analyzes and visualizes the wine quality dataset to gain insights into the factors affecting wine quality ratings. It provides interactive visualizations and allows users to explore the relationships between wine attributes and quality.

## Dataset
The wine quality dataset used in this project contains information about red and white wines, including various chemical properties and sensory ratings. It includes the following attributes:
- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free sulfur dioxide
- Total sulfur dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol
- Quality (rating from 0 to 10)

## Features
- Data Cleaning and Transformation: The dataset is cleaned and transformed in Power BI to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure data accuracy.
- Visualizations: The project includes a range of visualizations, such as bar charts, scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps, to explore relationships between wine attributes and quality ratings.
- Interactive Dashboard: All visualizations are combined into an interactive dashboard, allowing users to filter and drill down into specific attributes or wine types.
- Insights and Commentary: The report provides insights and commentary on the findings, highlighting important relationships and patterns in the data.
